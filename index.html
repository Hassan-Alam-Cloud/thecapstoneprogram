        <h1>The <span>Capstone</span> Program</h1>
        <p>
            A selective career-acceleration initiative designed to bridge the gap between
            high-potential students and real-world professional exposure.
        </p>

            <h2>Why The Capstone Program Exists</h2>
            <p>
                Many talented students graduate without clarity, exposure, or access to decision-makers
                shaping industries today. The Capstone Program exists to change that.
            </p>
            <p>
                We focus on structured exposure, mentorship-driven learning, and real conversations with
                professionals who operate at the highest levels of business, policy, and innovation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Participants Gain</h2>
            <p>
                Participants gain perspective, confidence, and direction — not through theory,
                but through guided engagement with experienced professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
                The emphasis is on decision-making, professional thinking, and understanding how careers
                actually unfold beyond classrooms and degrees.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The Capstone Program operates through a carefully curated structure that combines
                mentorship, exposure, and reflection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Details of the internal structure are shared selectively with participants to preserve
                quality, intent, and depth of engagement.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Who It Is For</h2>
            <p>
                The program is designed for students and early professionals who are ambitious,
                curious, and serious about long-term growth — not shortcuts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Selection prioritizes mindset, intent, and readiness over resumes alone.
            </p>

            <h2>Founder’s Note</h2>
            <p>
                The Capstone Program was created from firsthand experience navigating education,
                opportunity gaps, and professional ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is simple: create clarity before years are wasted, and exposure before
                decisions become irreversible.
